= Project: â€˜EdLights

Light randomiser. This is a trivial and largely pointless project. It is unlikely to be a panacea of contentment.

== Step 1: Installation
Put on your arduino and then run it.

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit
Im doing this with the Ikea usb lights plugged into the GPIO ports. They should draw around 30mA so OK. Do not plug in anything that draws more than 40mA/ port else the arduin o will blow up and your house will burn.
